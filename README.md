My Space Invaders game is a modern take on the classic 8-bit arcade favorite, rejuvenated with contemporary enhancements while retaining the original's charm. In this updated version, players enjoy new features like power-ups, which bring dynamic changes to the gameplay. These power-ups include healing to recover health and bullet spread to enhance the player's attack capabilities. The control scheme has been adapted for a more intuitive experience, with the player moving their spaceship using the WASD keys. Additionally, a strategic twist allows players to slow down their ship by holding the shift key, adding an extra layer of control and depth to the gameplay.
